#Session 1 : Intro to TensorFlow
  - Define waht you want to compute in the form of a Computation Graph. Running the Graph requires a session
  - Convolution: Filter the image. Example use case of tensorflow library 
  - Assignment: get 100 plus images and find mean, variance and sort them
  - Deep learning requires LOT of data. Figure out data before starting a Deep Learning project
  - Tha Data must try to cover for all variations so the NN can learn effectively. More data -> better learning.
  - **Datasets** search for deep learning datasets
